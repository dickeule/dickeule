Let's compare a simple search to a binary search.
Suppose, there is a list a, and:


```python
import re
a=[11, 17, 18, 19, 23, 32, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 48]
```

We would like to find, weather list a contain a number b, that could be entered.
At first, we try to find b with a simple search. The programm compares each of the list elements to b untill it find a match. If the match wasn't found, the programm reports it.


```python
def search_simple(b):
    print 'Simple search:'
    found=0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i]==b:
            print '%d %s %d %s' % (b, 'found, we had', i+1, 'tries')
            found=1
            break
    if found==0:
        print '%d %s %d %s' % (b, 'is not found, we had', i+1, 'tries')
```

Now we use a Binary search. Let's see the code:


```python
def search_binary(b):
    print 'Binary Search:'
    #We set the margins
    left=0
    right=len(a)
    found=0
    ii=0
    while left<right: #it works untill the margins differ from each other
        #we find the middle element of the list
        ii+=1
        middle=left+(right-left)//2
        if a[middle]==b:
            print '%d %s %d' % (b, 'found, that was step', ii)#if the middle element match b - 
            #the programm ends and reports us
            found=1
            break
        if b>a[middle]:
            #if b larger then the middle element, we should search only in the right part of the list, that start with 
            #an element next to the middle
            left=middle+1
        else:
            #if b smaller then the middle element, we should search only in the left part of the list, that start with 
            #an element previous to the middle
            right=middle-1
    if found==0:
        print '%d %s %d %s' % (b, 'is not found, we had', ii, 'tries')
```

We need to prove, that our input is an integer number:


```python
def try_input():
    c=raw_input('Input the number to find: ')
    if not (re.match('[^0-9]+', c)):
        search_simple(int(c))
        search_binary(int(c))
    else:
        print 'It was not a number!'
```

And now we start a program to see, what we have:


```python
try_input()
```

    Input the number to find: 1
    Simple search:
    1 is not found, we had 13 tries
    Binary Search:
    1 is not found, we had 3 tries
